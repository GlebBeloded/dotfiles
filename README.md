# Dotfiles
This repository is collections of dotfiles I personally use.

Currently I am using Fedora and there is a bootstrap script for Fedora if you want to try out my config. 

The dotfiles and programs here are centered around i3 and vim motions.

## Vscode bindings
if you see *motion*, that probably h,j,k or l
if action is connected to terminal or editor, they probably must be active

### general movement
Binding | Action
------- | ------
**ctrl+enter** | split, open another editor / terminal
**ctrl+[1..5]** | focus on editor / terminal 1..5
**ctrl+q** | close active editor tab / kill active terminal
**ctrl+shift+q** | close all editors
**ctrl+shift+motion** | resize terminal
**ctrl+h/l** | focus next / previous editor group
**ctrl+shift+space** | toggle terminal 
**ctrl+j/k** | go up/down in autocomplete thingy
**ctrl+f** | go to definition
**ctrl+shift+f** | go back
**ctrl+/** | global search ( **/** is regular search)
### files explorer
